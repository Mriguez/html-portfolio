<h1>The Best Movies According to Matias</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>
  I remember watching this movie at home at night and I really enjoyed watching
  it, especially Andrew's teacher because he was very strict with him and at the
  end Andrew cooked with the drum kit solo.
</p>
<h3>The Impossible</h3>
<p>
  This movie was really intense at the beggining because of the tsunami and
  everyone had bruises all over them, it was just pure madness the first 30
  minutes. Awesome movie.
</p>
<h3>Snatch</h3>
<p>
  I watched this movie recently and it was very fun. The movie was like
  different stories but all the stories lead you to the main problem which was
  the diamond. The story that I enjoyed watching the most was the one of the
  gypsies and the new van that they wanted. It's a very nice movie and I would
  watch it again.
